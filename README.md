# Blockchain-Based MSME Herbal Supply Chain

This project is a blockchain-based supply chain traceability system for MSME herbal products.

## Problem
Fake, untraceable and manipulated supply chains reduce trust in herbal and agricultural products.

## Solution
We built a smart contract on Ethereum that records:
- Farmer stage
- Processor stage
- Distributor stage

Each update is immutable and traceable by product ID.

## Tech Stack
- Solidity (Smart Contract)
- Remix IDE
- Ethers.js
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- MetaMask

## Features
- Role-based access control (Farmer, Processor, Distributor)
- Immutable product history
- Public verification using product ID
- Timestamped records
- Event emission for future analytics

## Status
Due to testnet faucet issues, full live transaction execution could not be shown, but contract logic and UI integration are fully implemented and demonstrated.
